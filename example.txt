Speed of vehicle A should be less than Speed of vehicle B by 10m/sec

The speed of the vehicle is more than displacement of the vehicle
vehicle_speed > vehicle_displacement

The speed of the vehicle plus the distance of the vehicle minus the velocity of the vehicle
vehicle_speed + vehicle_distance - vehicle_velocity

1. Distance between vehicle and vehicle should be within the range 10m and 70m.
Distance between FV_position and BV_position 10

vehicle_position - vehicle_position < 70
vehicle_position - vehicle_position > 10

FV_Vehicle_actual_gap.x >10m
FV_Vehicle_actual_gap.x <70m

FV_Vehicle.x - BV_Vehicle.x  >10m
FV_Vehicle.x - BV_Vehicle.x <70m



2. Lateral acceleration should be less than 0.1g
Lat_acc  < 0.1
l_acceleration < 0.1g

Speed of vehicle A should be less than Speed of vehicle B by 10m/sec

Speed of vehicle A [is] O[less than] speed of vehicle B [by] 10m/sec

Split:

Speed of vehicle A (vehicle_A_speed)   , is (=) , O(less than) < (overwrite previous), vehicle_B_speed, by, 10m/s

vehicle_A_speed = < vehicle_B_speed by 10   => vehicle_A_speed<vehicle_B_speed-10

vehcile_A_speed = > vehicle_B_speed by 10   => vehicle_A_speed<vehicle_B_speed+10
